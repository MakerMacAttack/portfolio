        NurseLine was my first group project. Working as part of a team can be
        extremely rewarding and effective, but of course also provides its own
        unique challenges, and this was no exception. The teaching staff of both
        my DevOps team and our UX partners deliberately gave us the opportunity
        to build our own structure and resolve our own conflicts. It wasn't
        always easy, but we all learned a lot about collaboration and ended up
        with a project stronger than any of us could have made on our own.
