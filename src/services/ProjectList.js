    title: "Whodunnit?",
    about: "A simple game where the user inspects evidence and interviews witnesses to figure out who the killer is.",
    tech: "Reach App front-end with a Ruby on Rails backend.",
    link: "https://whodunnit.surge.sh",
    lessons: "Whodunnit represented my first full-stack solo project. It was a lot of exhausting work to do everything on time and on deadline, but my experience with dependable coding proved essential. Rather than leap in and try to slap together whatever I thought would work, I started with careful planning and scaffolding. Before I had written my first line of code, I knew how I wanted the end product to be. From those solid foundations I was able to proceed calmly through the project. When an unexpected snag did crop up, I took a step back and dealt with it from the broader perspective. I ended up with elegant code efficiently running a robust program with an intuitive user interface.",

    title: "NurseLine",
    about: "A resource for nurses to blog and share motivation and advice, potentially anonymously, without fear of reprisal.",
    tech: "React App front-end with MongoDB back-end.",
    link: "https://nurseline.netlify.app",
    lessons: "NurseLine was my first group project. Working as part of a team can be extremely rewarding and effective, but of course also provides its own unique challenges, and this was no exception. The teaching staff of both my DevOps team and our UX partners deliberately gave us the opportunity to build our own structure and resolve our own conflicts. It wasn't always easy, but we all learned a lot about collaboration and ended up with a project stronger than any of us could have made on our own.",
  github: "nurse-line"},
  {
    title: "Clobber",
    about: "A board game where you play an AI opponent at varying levels of difficulty. The object is to be the last player to capture an opponent's piece. The app uses an Airtable API to store high-scores, which can be sorted by difficulty level if desired.",
    tech: "React App front-end with Express back-end.",
    link: "https://clobber.netlify.app",
    lessons: "Clobber was my introduction to many of the fundamentals of styling options. It taught me the core competencies of responsive displays and has provided the foundation from which I have been learning and growing in the best ways to design and present my projects with the end-user's ease and optimal functionality in mind.",
