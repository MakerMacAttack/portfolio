    lessons: "Whodunnit represented my first full-stack solo project. It was a lot of exhausting work to do everything on time and on deadline, but my experience with dependable coding proved essential. Rather than leap in and try to slap together whatever I thought would work, I started with careful planning and scaffolding. Before I had written my first line of code, I knew how I wanted the end product to be. From those solid foundations I was able to proceed calmly through the project. When an unexpected snag did crop up, I took a step back and dealt with it from the broader perspective. I ended up with elegant code efficiently running a robust program with an intuitive user interface.",

    link: "https://nurseline.netlify.app",
    lessons: "NurseLine was my first group project. Working as part of a team can be extremely rewarding and effective, but of course also provides its own unique challenges, and this was no exception. The teaching staff of both my DevOps team and our UX partners deliberately gave us the opportunity to build our own structure and resolve our own conflicts. It wasn't always easy, but we all learned a lot about collaboration and ended up with a project stronger than any of us could have made on our own.",

    lessons: "Clobber was my introduction to many of the fundamentals of styling options. It taught me the core competencies of responsive displays and has provided the foundation from which I have been learning and growing in the best ways to design and present my projects with the end-user's ease and optimal functionality in mind.",
